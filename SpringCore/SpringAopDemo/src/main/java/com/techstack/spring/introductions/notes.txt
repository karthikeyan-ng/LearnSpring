	 	Introductions (advance topic)
		
		Introductions (known as inter-type declarations in AspectJ) enable an aspect to declare 
		that advised objects implement a given interface, and to provide an implementation of 
		that interface on behalf of those objects.

		An introduction is made using the @DeclareParents annotation. This annotation is used to 
		declare that matching types have a new parent (hence the name). 
		For example, given an interface UsageTracked, and an implementation of 
		that interface DefaultUsageTracked, the following aspect declares 
		that all implementors of service interfaces also implement the UsageTracked interface. 
		(In order to expose statistics via JMX for example.)

 	    The interface to be implemented is determined by the type of the annotated field. 
	    The value attribute of the @DeclareParents annotation is an AspectJ type pattern :- 
	    any bean of a matching type will implement the UsageTracked interface. 
	    Note that in the before advice of the above example, service beans can be 
	    directly used as implementations of the UsageTracked interface.
