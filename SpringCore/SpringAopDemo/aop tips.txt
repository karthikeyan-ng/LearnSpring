Tips:
=====
Autodetecting aspects through component scanning
		You may register aspect classes as regular beans in your Spring XML configuration, or 
		autodetect them through classpath scanning - just like any other Spring-managed bean. 
		However, note that the @Aspect annotation is not sufficient for autodetection in the classpath: 
		For that purpose, you need to add a separate @Component annotation 
		(or alternatively a custom stereotype annotation that qualifies, as per the rules of Springâ€™s component scanner).
		
Advising aspects with other aspects?
		In Spring AOP, it is not possible to have aspects themselves be the target of advice from other aspects. 
		The @Aspect annotation on a class marks it as an aspect, and hence excludes it from auto-proxying.
