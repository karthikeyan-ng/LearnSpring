/**
 * To receive the custom ApplicationEvent, create a class that implements ApplicationListener and register it 
 * as a Spring bean. The following example demonstrates such a class:
 * 
 * Notice that ApplicationListener is generically parameterized with the type of your custom event, BlackListEvent. 
 * This means that the onApplicationEvent() method can remain type-safe, avoiding any need for downcasting. 
 * You may register as many event listeners as you wish, but note that by default event listeners receive events 
 * synchronously. This means the publishEvent() method blocks until all listeners have finished processing the event. 
 * One advantage of this synchronous and single-threaded approach is that when a listener receives an event, 
 * it operates inside the transaction context of the publisher if a transaction context is available. 
 * If another strategy for event publication becomes necessary, refer to the javadoc for 
 * Spring’s ApplicationEventMulticaster interface.

     * 
     * You can create the following listener definition to only receive EntityCreatedEvent for a Person:

     * Due to type erasure, this will only work if the event that is fired resolves the generic parameter(s) on which the 
     * event listener filters on (that is something like class PersonCreatedEvent extends EntityCreatedEvent<Person> { …​ }).

     * In certain circumstances, this may become quite tedious if all events follow the same structure (as it should be the 
     * case for the event above). In such a case, you can implement ResolvableTypeProvider to guide the framework beyond 
     * what the runtime environment provides:
     * 
	 * This works not only for ApplicationEvent but any arbitrary object that you’d send as an event.
